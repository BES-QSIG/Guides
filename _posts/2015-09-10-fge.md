title: Soon to be released!
---

We're about to release the website! It's coming to the end of September
and our release date is for the 30th September. We've made a lot of improvements
since the first incarnation of the website: http://bes-qsig.github.io/test-cge/

Major feature improvements since then have been:

* Parallax background image
* Rotating background images
* Google search bar
* Automatic authorship
* Automatic linking by theme ("Also in ...")

The next major task will be to increase the number of documents. So far only 3
people have contributed to the [docs repo](https://github.com/BES-QSIG/docs)!
