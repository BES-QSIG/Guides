<p>We&#39;re about to release the website! It&#39;s coming to the end of September
and our release date is for the 30th September. We&#39;ve made a lot of improvements
since the first incarnation of the website: <a href="http://bes-qsig.github.io/test-cge/">http://bes-qsig.github.io/test-cge/</a></p>

<p>Major feature improvements since then have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallax background image</li>
<li>Rotating background images</li>
<li>Google search bar</li>
<li>Automatic authorship</li>
<li>Automatic linking by theme (&quot;Also in ...&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<p>The next major task will be to increase the number of documents. So far only 3
people have contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/BES-QSIG/docs">docs repo</a>!</p>
